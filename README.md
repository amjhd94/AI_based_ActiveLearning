### AI-based explorer agents discovering the most informative training data within the input domain. 
The agents take advantage of likelihood and output weighted acuiqisiotn funxctions to search the input domain for discovering the most informative point to train neural network models.

The "RareEvent_TippingPoint_discovery_demo.py" code includes a quick demo showing how the algorithms work and how the several accuracy metrics develope with the addition of the discovered data points.
